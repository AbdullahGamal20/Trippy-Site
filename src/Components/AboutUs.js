      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        Trippy, short for "trippy art" or "trippy graphics," emerged as a
        popular artistic movement and aesthetic in the late 1960s and early
        1970s, largely influenced by the counterculture movements and the rise
        of psychedelic substances such as LSD. It is characterized by vibrant
        and surreal visuals with a unique blend of colors, patterns, and
        distorted perspectives. The roots of the trippy art movement can be
        traced back to the art and music scenes of the 1960s, particularly in
        San Francisco and London. Artists, musicians, and designers sought to
        express their experiences with psychedelic substances and altered states
        of consciousness through their creative works. These artworks often
        featured mind-bending patterns, swirling colors, and intricate designs
        that aimed to simulate hallucinatory experiences.
